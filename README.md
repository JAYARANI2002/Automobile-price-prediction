# Automobile-price-prediction
For this project, we are using the dataset on used car sales from all over the United States, available on
Kaggle. The features available in this dataset are Mileage, VIN, Make, Model, Year, State and City
Discription
  Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive
a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that
can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.
We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of
different makes and models across cities in the United States. Our results show that Random Forest
model and K-Means clustering with linear regression yield the best results, but are compute heavy.
Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower
training time in comparison to the aforementioned methods.
